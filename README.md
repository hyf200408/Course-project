# Description for my course project
This is my course project for "Getting and Cleaning Data" of Coursera.

The R script "run_analysis.R" contains the codes to generate the required tidy data set. When running the script, please make sure the original Samsung data has already been **unzipped** and **stored in your working directory**. It is composed of six functions and one body, and the body calls the pre-defined functions to sequentially fulfill the 5 steps of instructions. Detailed descriptions are attached in the R script as comments.

The text file "tidy data set.txt" is a sample output created in step 5 of the instructions for the course project. Row names are removed according to the project requirements.

The markdown file "CodeBook.md" is the codebook for the tidy data set produced in step 5 of the instructions. It is modified from the original codebooks of the Samsung data.
